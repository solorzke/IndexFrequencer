For this assignment, you are free to reference code from online (not direct copy).  
Your program should produce a frequency-based inverted index, in the same format as 
the one in slide #9 of Chap 5 ppt, in a plain text file. 

Input: 500 downloaded pages from Assignment 2.

Output: an inverted index stored in a plain text file.

Report: Part A) how the indexing function was developed (programming language used, 
and major functions); and Part B) collection statistics: 

1. number of documents indexed, and 
2. Vocabulary (total number of unique terms).

Deliverables: a zip file containing 

1. source code, 
2. report, 
3. the resultant inverted index file, and 
4. a list of unique terms stored in a plain text file.

Presentation: The assignment is due on March 16.  
On March 20, you will be required to demo your program, show the outputs, and explain the code in class.

Extra Credits

 Two extra points are given to those who can produce an inverted index in 2 formats: 

1. Frequency-based (Slide #9) and 
2. position-based (slide #10) in Chap 5 ppt.
